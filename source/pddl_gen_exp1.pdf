Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

You are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door.

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed plain door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed screen door. To the West you see a closed plain door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format).

When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format).

To the North you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format).

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed patio door. To the West you see a closed wood door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed wood door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed screen door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed wood door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see the living room. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed plain door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the South you see a closed patio door. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the living room. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the living room. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the South you see a closed sliding patio door. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed wood door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see the corridor. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. To the West you see the corridor. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it.

Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed screen door. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed wood door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed screen door. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed plain door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the South you see a closed sliding patio door. To the East you see the living room. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed patio door. To the South you see a closed wood door. To the East you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the West you see a closed wood door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed wood door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. To the West you see the corridor. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed screen door. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the corridor. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the West you see the living room. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the living room. To the East you see the corridor. To the West you see a closed frosted-glass door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed plain door. To the East you see a closed sliding patio door. To the West you see a closed wood door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see the corridor. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the East you see a closed wood door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed frosted-glass door. To the East you see the living room. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed sliding patio door. To the South you see a closed frosted-glass door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see the living room. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed wood door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed plain door. To the West you see a closed sliding patio door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it. We will be using the following domain file:\n(define (domain environment)\n  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions :disjunctive-preconditions)\n  (:types\n    location\n    direction\n  )\n  (:predicates\n    (at ?loc - location)\n    (visited ?loc - location)\n    (connected ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    (closed_door ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  )\n\n  (:action move\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?dir - direction)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 ?loc2 ?dir) (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2)))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?loc1)) (at ?loc2))\n  )\n\n  (:action open_door\n    :parameters (?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?loc1) (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n    :effect (not (closed_door ?loc1 ?loc2))\n  )\n)\n\nYour always start in the kitchen and your task is always to go to a location you have not been yet. Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see a closed plain door. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]

Priting some checks now:
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will continue to build a PDDL representation of an environment while exploring it.

Therefore, you will start with the following problem file.\n(define (problem exploration)\n  (:domain environment)\n  (:objects\n    kitchen - location\n    north south east west - direction\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at kitchen)\n    (visited kitchen)\n  )\n  (:goal \n    (exists (?x - location)\n        (and\n            (not (visited ?x))\n            (at ?x)\n        )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nLet\'s work with an example. Say you\'re given this observation:\nYou are in the kitchen. To the South you see a closed wooden door. To the East you see a closed glass door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc1 - location",\n      "loc2 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc2 east)",\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc2)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {},\n    "delete": []\n  }\n}\n\nNote a couple of things:\n1. When you see a closed door, you would use a placeholder for the room behind the door.\n2. When you enter a room, you learn the name of the room and will replace the placeholder with the name. You should also make sure to replace that name for all relations under "init".\n3. When you enter a room, you\'re "at" the room and it becomes "visited". You should also delete other "at" conditions because you can only be at one room.\n4. You should never delete the "visited" relations, because once a room is visited, it will remain that way.\n\nAt this point you will gain further observations:\nAction: open door to south\nYou open the wooden door, revealing the pantry.\nAction: move south\nYou are in the pantry. Through an open sliding patio door, to the North you see the kitchen. To the West you see a closed screen door.\n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, replace, and delete operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.\n{\n  "objects": {\n    "add": [\n      "loc3 - location"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "loc1 - location": "pantry - location"\n    },\n    "delete": []\n  },\n  "init": {\n    "add": [\n      "(visited pantry)",\n      "(connected pantry kitchen north)",\n      "(connected pantry loc3 west)",\n      "(closed_door pantry loc3)"\n    ],\n    "replace": {\n      "(at kitchen)": "(at pantry)",\n      "(connected kitchen loc1 south)": "(connected kitchen pantry south)"\n    },\n    "delete": [\n      "(closed_door kitchen loc1)"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow, let\'s start afresh. \nAction: look around\nYou are in the kitchen. To the North you see a closed plain door. To the South you see the corridor. To the East you see a closed wood door. To the West you see the living room. \n\nYou will modify the above problem file using add, delate, and replace operations (in a JSON format). You SHOULD NOT provide a problem file directly.'}]
