The AI agent in this domain is tasked with exploring a series of connected rooms, each represented as a unique location. The ultimate goal of the agent is to locate and collect a coin hidden in one of these rooms. The agent does not initially know where the coin is located and must systematically explore the rooms to find it. Rooms may be connected by doors, some of which are locked and need to be opened to allow passage. The agent can only move between rooms if a door is open, and if the rooms are connected in the desired direction. The agent can open a closed door if it is in the current location of that door. The agent is designed to remember which rooms it has already visited to avoid revisiting them unnecessarily. By continuously exploring unvisited rooms, the agent progresses toward its main goal of discovering the room containing the coin.
