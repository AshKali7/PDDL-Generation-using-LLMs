You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:
No predicate has been defined yet
--------------------
--------------------
1. ?p - package: the package to load
2. ?t - truck: the truck to load the package into

Preconditions:
```
(and
    (at ?p ?l) ; the package ?p is at location ?l
    (at ?t ?l) ; the truck ?t is at location ?l
    (truck-empty ?t) ; the truck ?t is empty
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
    (not (at ?p ?l))
    (not (truck-empty ?t))
    (truck-loaded ?t ?p) ; the truck ?t is loaded with package ?p
)
```

New Predicates:
1. (at ?o - object, ?l - location): true if the object ?o is at location ?l
2. (truck-empty ?t - truck): true if the truck ?t is empty
3. (truck-loaded ?t - truck, ?p - package): true if the truck ?t is loaded with package ?p

3. (truck-loaded ?t - truck, ?p - package): true if the truck ?t is loaded with package ?p
--------------------
--------------------
1. ?p - package: the package to unload
2. ?t - truck: the truck from which to unload the package

Preconditions:
```
(and
    (at ?p ?t)
    (truck-loaded ?t ?p)
)

Effects:
```
